### **Steps to Perform the Project**

1. **Import the Dataset:**
   Open IBM SPSS Modeler and bring in the student dataset containing academic, attendance, and demographic records.

2. **Clean and Prepare the Data:**
   Handle missing values, remove duplicates, convert categorical fields if needed, and organize data for modeling.

3. **Define the Target Field:**
   Select *Student Status* (Continue vs Dropout) as the target variable to predict, and mark other relevant fields as inputs.

4. **Build the Predictive Model:**
   Apply a suitable model such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, or Neural Network to learn patterns from the data.

5. **Evaluate the Model and Analyze Results:**
   Check model accuracy, observe important predictor variables, and interpret which factors contribute most to student churn.
